//parameterized input
//We cannot assign a value like firstName = input(...) directly at top-level inside steps {} block in declarative pipeline.
//In Declarative Pipelines, steps must only have "atomic" steps (like echo, sh, input),
// and variable assignment must happen inside a script {} block.

/*
üß† Do you need an agent for atomic steps like echo, input, sleep, etc.?

Situation	                                                                            Need agent?                 	Why?
Steps that run inside Jenkins master/controller memory (like echo, input, sleep)	‚ùå No agent needed	These are Groovy/Pipeline operations. They don‚Äôt require a real machine or shell.
Steps that need OS-level commands (like sh, bat, git, docker)	‚úÖ Agent needed	Jenkins must have a real node/agent to run shell/batch commands.
